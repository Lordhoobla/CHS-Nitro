Metals conduct heat well, but air does not. This is a direct contact type of heat transfer.\n\nConvection\nConvection is heat transfer by the movement of mass from one place to another. It can take place only in liquids and gases. Heat gained by conduction or radiation is moved by convection.\n\nRadiation\nRadiation can transfer heat through the relative emptiness of space. All other forms of heat transfer require motion of molecules like air or water to move heat.");
